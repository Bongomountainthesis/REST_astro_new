New REST ChIPs on NS5 derived Astrocytes. Samples produced by Chiara, to replace those from Manu (which were abit shit).

Am comparing REST binding in astrocytes and NS5s and correlating with dominant negative expression data (currently only have astrocyte data, am sending NS5 domneg repeat to Barts).
